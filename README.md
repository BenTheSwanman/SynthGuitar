# SynthGuitar
Allows use of a Redoctane X-Plorer Controller to control a digital synth. Currently only plays pure sine waves, but stay tuned for more interesting sounds.

Also includes the world-famous guitar-calculator, for all those times when you forgot your calculator but remembered your X-Plorer guitar. This will probably get its own repository once it's been more fleshed out.
